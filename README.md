# Jeffrey Zhou - V1 Portfolio Website

This repository contains the legacy version (v1) of my portfolio website, created back in 2022/2023. It lived at [jsz.ext.io](https://jsz.ext.io), with the subdomain provided for free by [FreeDNS](https://freedns.afraid.org/subdomain/) (shoutout to Josh) and hosted via WebHostMost.

The original ext.io domain now has a redirect to my updated site. V1 was used until I revamped my website into an interactive React/TypeScript based version in 2024.
